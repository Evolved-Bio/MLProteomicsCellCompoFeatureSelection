Skeletal Muscle Proteomics Analysis Using Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing proteomics data, particularly focusing on skeletal muscle tissues, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to integrate data from multiple studies to uncover biologically relevant patterns that traditional analysis methods might not reveal, facilitating a unified understanding across datasets.

Contents
data_processing.py: Standardizes and combines protein IDs from multiple experiments.
data_augmentation.py: Augments the dataset with cellular composition data, categorizing proteins.
analysis.py: Performs comprehensive analyses including PCA, LDA, and more.
model_training.py: Develops and evaluates a Random Forest classifier for condition classification.
feature_selection.py: Implements feature selection to improve model performance.
model_deployment.py: Deploys the trained model on new datasets to predict condition similarities.
Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install dependencies with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run scripts sequentially, building upon the results of the previous steps:

python data_processing.py
python data_augmentation.py
python analysis.py
python model_training.py
python feature_selection.py
python model_deployment.py
