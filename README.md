**Machine Learning and Proteomics: Leveraging Domain Knowledge for Feature Selection in a Skeletal Muscle Tissue Meta-analysis**

Overview:

This repository contains Python scripts used as part of an original research paper [insert DOI here] proteomics datasets from different experiments with focus on skeletal muscle tissues, its 2D and 3D _in vitro_ models, in vivo muscle and its adjacent tissues incvluding tendons, are combined and used for training machine learning tools. The goal is to use domain knowledge, cellular compositional data fetched from online databases such as Uniprot and Ensembl in particular, for categoriziation as an alternative to routinely used feature selection methods. This approach was shown to uncover biologically relevant patterns that traditional analysis methods could not reveal, facilitating a more whjolistic view of.

Contents:
data_processing.py: Standardizes and combines protein IDs from multiple experiments.
data_augmentation.py: Augments the dataset with cellular composition data, categorizing proteins.
analysis.py: Performs comprehensive analyses including PCA, LDA, and more.
model_training.py: Develops and evaluates a Random Forest classifier for condition classification.

Installation:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install dependencies with:
